### Intelligent Missile Guidance Research


## Abstract of the project

The trajectory of classic missile is quite predictable since the optimal guidance law has been revealed a long time ago. </br>
Thus, it is pretty inevitable that the advent of guidance and control law of missile with noise-robustness and being novel. </br>
The coming research trend of guidance and control problems obviously is to be an intelligent one. </br>
That's the reason this project focus on the novel missile guidance law to be gotten neural network
