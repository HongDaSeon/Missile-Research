### Intelligent Missile Guidance Research


## Abstract of the project

The trajectory of classic missile is quite predictable since the optimal guidance law has been revealed a long time ago. </br>
Thus, it is pretty inevitable that the advent of guidance and control law of missile with noise-robustness and being novel. </br>
The coming research trend of guidance and control problems obviously is to be intelligent one. </br>
That's the reason this project focus on the novel missile guidance law to be gotten neural network

## What is or going to be in the repository

> data gathering Missile environment for SL

> 2D and 3D RL environment of missile

> 2D abd 3D environment of target to dodge a missile

> The dynamics core of missile is going to be dynamic link library(dll) type
